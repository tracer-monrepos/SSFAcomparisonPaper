# Contents

This [README.md](/README.md) file has been created by rendering the [README.Rmd](/README.Rmd) file.

The [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file contains information about the version, author, license and packages. For details on the license, see the [LICENSE.md](/LICENSE.md) and [LICENSE](/LICENSE) files.

The [`r repo`.Rproj](/`r repo`.Rproj) file is the RStudio project file.

The [R_analysis](/R_analysis) directory contains all files related to the R analysis. It is composed of the following folders:

- [:file_folder: derived_data](/R_analysis/derived_data): output data generated during the analysis (script [SSFA_1\_Import.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.Rmd)).  
- [:file_folder: plots](/R_analysis/plots): plots generated during the analyses (script [SSFA_3\_Plots.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.Rmd)).  
- [:file_folder: raw_data](/R_analysis/raw_data): input data used in the analyses (script [SSFA_1\_Import.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.Rmd)).  
- [:file_folder: scripts](/R_analysis/scripts): scripts used to run the analyses.  
- [:file_folder: summary_stats](/R_analysis/summary_stats): summary statistics generated during the analyses (script [SSFA_2\_Summary-stats.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_2_Summary-stats.Rmd)).

The [scripts](/R_analysis/scripts) directory contains the following files:

- [SSFA_0_RStudioVersion.R](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_0_RStudioVersion.R): script to get the used version of RStudio and write it to a TXT file ([RStudioVersion.txt](/R_analysis/scripts/RStudioVersion.txt)). This is necessary as the function `RStudio.Version()` can only be run in an interactive session (see [this post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/rstudio-version-not-found-on-knit/8088) for details).
- [SSFA_0_CreateRC.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_0_CreateRC.Rmd): script used to create this research compendium - it is not part of the analysis *per se* and is not meant to be run again. Rendered to [SSFA_0_CreateRC.md](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_0_CreateRC.md).  
- [SSFA_1_Import.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.Rmd): script to import the raw, input data. Rendered to [SSFA_1_Import.md](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.md) and [SSFA_1_Import.html](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.html).  
- [SSFA_2_Summary-stats.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_2_Summary-stats.Rmd): script to compute group-wise summary statistics. Rendered to [SSFA_2_Summary-stats.md](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_2_Summary-stats.md) and [SSFA_2_Summary-stats.html](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_2_Summary-stats.html).  
- [SSFA_3_Plots.Rmd](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.Rmd): script to produce plots for each SSFA variable. Rendered to [SSFA_3_Plots.md](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.md) and [SSFA_3_Plots.html](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.html).  
- [SSFA_3_Plots_files](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots_files/figure-gfm/): contains PNG files of the plots; used in the [SSFA_3_Plots.md](/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.md) file.

The [Python_analysis](/Python_analysis) directory contains all files related to the Python analysis. It is composed of the following folders:

- 

Note that the HTML files are not rendered nicely on GitHub; you need to download them and open them with your browser. Use the MD files to view on GitHub. However, MD files do not have all functionalities of HTML files (numbered sections, floating table of content). I therefore recommend using the HTML files.  
To download an HTML file from GitHub, first display the "raw" file and then save it as HTML.

Alternatively, use [GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) to render it directly.  
Here are direct links to display the files directly in your browser:

- [SSFA_1_Import.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tracer-monrepos/SSFAcomparisonPaper/blob/master/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_1_Import.html)  
- [SSFA_2_Summary-stats.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tracer-monrepos/SSFAcomparisonPaper/blob/master/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_2_Summary-stats.html)  
- [SSFA_3_Plots.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tracer-monrepos/SSFAcomparisonPaper/blob/master/R_analysis/scripts/SSFA_3_Plots.html)  
- 

The [renv.lock](/renv.lock) file is the lockfile describing the state of the project's library. It is associated to the [activation script](/renv/activate.R) and the project's library. All these files have been created using the package [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).

The [.binder](/.binder) directory contains the Docker image (see section [How to run in your browser or download and run locally](#how-to-run-in-your-browser-or-download-and-run-locally)).

See the section [Contributions](#contributions) for details on [CONDUCT.md](/CONDUCT.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


# How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need to install on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to open an instance of RStudio in your browser using [binder](https://mybinder.org/), either by clicking on the "launch binder" badge at the top of this README, or by following [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tracer-monrepos/`r repo`/master?urlpath=rstudio). Binder will have the compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can also download the compendium as [a ZIP archive](https://github.com/tracer-monrepos/`r repo`/archive/master.zip).  
Alternatively, if you use GitHub, you can [fork and clone](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) the repository to your account. See also the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

If you want to work locally, either from the ZIP archive or from cloning the GitHub repository to your computer:

-   open the ``r repo`.Rproj` file in RStudio; this takes some time the first time.  
-   run `renv::status()` and then `renv::restore()` to restore the state of your project from [renv.lock](/renv.lock). Make sure that the package `devtools` is installed to be able to install packages from source.

Using the package `renv` implies that installing, removing and updating packages is done within the project. In other words, all the packages that you install/update while in a project using `renv` will not be available in any other project. If you want to globally install/remove/update packages, make sure you close the project first.
