Note that the HTML files are not rendered nicely on GitHub; you need to download them and open them with your browser. Use the MD files to view on GitHub. However, MD files do not have all functionalities of HTML files (numbered sections, floating table of content). I therefore recommend using the HTML files.  
To download an HTML file from GitHub, first display the "raw" file and then save it as HTML.

Alternatively, use [GitHub & BitBucket HTML Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/) to render it directly.  
Here are direct links to display the files directly in your browser:

The [renv.lock](/renv.lock) file is the lockfile describing the state of the R project's library. It is associated to the [activation script](/renv/activate.R) and the R project's library. All these files have been created using the package [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html).

The [.binder](/.binder) directory contains the Docker image for the R analysis, while [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) contains the instruction to build the Docker image for the Python analysis. See section [How to run in your browser or download and run locally](#how-to-run-in-your-browser-or-download-and-run-locally) for details.

# How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming languages R and Python. To work with the compendium, you will need to install on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for the R analysis, and [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) and the packages listed in [requirements.txt](/Python_analysis/requirements.txt) for the Python analysis.

The simplest way to explore the R analysis is to open an instance of RStudio in your browser using [binder](https://mybinder.org/), either by clicking on the "launch binder" badge at the top of this README, or by following [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tracer-monrepos/`r repo`/master?urlpath=rstudio). Binder will have the compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

If you want to work locally with the R analysis, either from the ZIP archive or from cloning the GitHub repository to your computer:

- open the ``r repo`.Rproj` file in RStudio; this takes some time the first time.  
- run `renv::status()` and then `renv::restore()` to restore the state of your project from [renv.lock](/renv.lock). Make sure that the package `devtools` is installed to be able to install packages from source.

Using the package `renv` implies that installing, removing and updating packages is done within the project. In other words, all the packages that you install/update while in a project using `renv` will not be available in any other project. If you want to globally install/remove/update packages, make sure you close the project first.

For the Python analysis, the easiest way is to use the Docker image hosted on [Zenodo](). The detailed instructions are given in [RUN_DOCKER.md](/Python_analysis/RUN_DOCKER.md).

You can also download the compendium as [a ZIP archive](https://github.com/tracer-monrepos/`r repo`/archive/master.zip).  
Alternatively, if you use GitHub, you can [fork and clone](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) the repository to your account. See also the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
